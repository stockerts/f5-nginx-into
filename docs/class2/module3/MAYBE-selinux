Enforce Security with SELinux Policy

This documentation applies to NGINX Instance Manager 2.0.0 and later.

Overview 
You can use the optional SELinux policy module that’s included in the package to secure NGINX Instance Manager operations with flexible, mandatory access control that follows the principle of least privilege.

The scope of the SELinux policy allows NGINX Instance Manager to perform all the operations needed to support the default configuration, including inter-process communication on the default Unix sockets and TCP as an alternative. Other changes may need manual adjustments to the default policy for the application to work.

Important:
The attached SELinux policy module is optional. As such, the module will not be loaded automatically during an installation even if you are using an SELinux-enabled system and requires manual action to become active.
Before You Begin 
To complete this tutorial, take the following preparatory steps:

Enable SELinux on your system.
Install the following tools: load_policy, semodule, and restorecon.
Install NGINX Instance Manager with SELinux module files in place.
Important:
SElinux can be configured to use permissive mode. In permissive mode, policy violations are logged instead of enforced. Make sure you know which mode your SELinux configuration uses.
Install the SELinux policy module 
The NGINX Instance Manager installer places the SELinux policy files in the following locations:

/usr/share/selinux/packages/nms.pp - loadable binary policy module
/usr/share/selinux/devel/include/contrib/nms.if - interface definitions file
/usr/share/man/man8/nms_selinux.8.gz - policy man page
You can interact with these files to learn about the policy. See the following section for steps on how to load the policy.

Load SELinux policy module 

To use the SELinux policy with NGINX Instance Manager, take the following steps before starting the services:

Install and load the policy:

sudo semodule -n -i /usr/share/selinux/packages/nms.pp
sudo /usr/sbin/load_policy
Label the necessary files according to their definitions:

sudo restorecon -F -R /usr/bin/nms-core
sudo restorecon -F -R /usr/bin/nms-dpm
sudo restorecon -F -R /usr/bin/nms-ingestion
sudo restorecon -F -R /usr/lib/systemd/system/nms.service
sudo restorecon -F -R /usr/lib/systemd/system/nms-core.service
sudo restorecon -F -R /usr/lib/systemd/system/nms-dpm.service
sudo restorecon -F -R /usr/lib/systemd/system/nms-ingestion.service
sudo restorecon -F -R /var/lib/nms/modules/manager.json
sudo restorecon -F -R /var/lib/nms/modules.json
sudo restorecon -F -R /var/lib/nms/streaming
sudo restorecon -F -R /var/lib/nms
sudo restorecon -F -R /var/lib/nms/dqlite
sudo restorecon -F -R /var/run/nms
sudo restorecon -F -R /var/lib/nms/modules
sudo restorecon -F -R /var/log/nms
Restart the NGINX Instance Manager services if they are already running.

sudo systemctl restart nms
Add ports to SELinux context 

NGINX Instance Manager uses the nms_t context in the policy module. The following example shows how to add a new port to the context. You should add external ports to the firewall exceptions. Note, as a system admin, you’re responsible for any custom configurations that differ from the default policy.

To add TCP ports 10000 and 11000 to the nmx_t context, run the following commands:

sudo semanage port -a -t nms_t -p tcp 10000
sudo semanage port -a -t nms_t -p tcp 11000
If you’ve already defined the port context, replace -a with -m:

sudo semanage port -m -t nms_t -p tcp 10000
sudo semanage port -m -t nms_t -p tcp 11000
Remove ports from SELinux context 

If you uninstall NGINX Instance Manager, you should remove the ports. To do this, run the following commands:

sudo semanage port -d -t nms_t 10000
sudo semanage port -d -t nms_t 11000
Enabling SELinux for NGINX Agent 
The following SELinux files are added when installing the NGINX Agent package:

/usr/share/selinux/packages/nginx_agent.pp - loadable binary policy module
/usr/share/selinux/devel/include/contrib/nginx_agent.if - interface definitions file
/usr/share/man/man8/nginx_agent_selinux.8.gz - policy man page
You can follow the same steps above to load the SELinux policy for the NGINX Agent.
