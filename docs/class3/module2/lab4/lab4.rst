Enable NGINX App Protect on the Arcadia Finance App
===================================================

Now you will now enable NGINX App Protect and apply a WAF policy to the Arcadia Finance app.

.. attention:: The release we've used in the lab, 2.8.0, has a known issue. This issue is fixed in releases 2.9.0 and higher. Due to time restrictions, we were unable to upgrade this lab prior to the event. 
  
  For details on the known-issue, refer to *Precompiled Publication setting is reverted to false after error publishing NGINX App Protect policy* on the `NGINX Management Suite Known Issues <https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-management-suite/nim/releases/known-issues/>`_ page.

1. First, you'll need to address the known-issue in the lab's release of NGINX Management Suite. From the **Applications** menu, click **SSH Shortcuts** and log into **nginx-plus-2**. Issue the following command: 

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo sed -i 's/precompiled_publication: true/precompiled_publication: false/g' /etc/nginx-agent/nginx-agent.conf; sudo systemctl restart nginx-agent; sleep 7; sudo sed -i 's/precompiled_publication: false/precompiled_publication: true/g' /etc/nginx-agent/nginx-agent.conf; sudo systemctl restart nginx-agent

2. Open **Firefox** and click on the  **NMS** bookmark.

7. Add the following configuration lines to the **server** block that includes the *listen 443 ssl* directive:

.. code-block:: bash

      app_protect_enable on;
      app_protect_policy_file "/etc/nms/AgilityPolicy.tgz";
      app_protect_security_log_enable on;
      app_protect_security_log "/etc/nms/secops_dashboard.tgz" syslog:server=127.0.0.1:514;

Your screen should look similar to below:
